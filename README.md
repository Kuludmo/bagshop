## 📌 Project Overview
The Bag Shop Platform is a full-stack e-commerce web application designed for buying and managing bags online.
It includes both user-facing features and an admin management system, built with a modern frontend and a RESTful backend.

The system is divided into two main parts:

Frontend: Handles the user interface, navigation, and user interactions.

Backend: Manages data storage, authentication, and business logic.

🧑‍💻 User Side

Regular users can:

Browse a list of available bags

View detailed information for each bag

Register and log in securely

Access their profile page

Interact with a responsive and modern UI

🛠️ Admin Side

Admins have access to a protected dashboard where they can:

Add new bags

Edit existing bag details

Delete bags

View and manage users

Control the content displayed on the platform

⚙️ Technical Flow

The frontend (Next.js) communicates with the backend API using HTTP requests.

The backend (Node.js + Express) handles:

Authentication

API routes

Database operations

MongoDB is used to store user and product (bag) data.

The application follows a client–server architecture, making it scalable and maintainable.
